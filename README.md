# MicroMentor Flutter App

This is MicroMentor's main Flutter application. 

## Getting Started

### Connecting To The Backend

Create the file `assets/.env` with this content:

    APP_GRAPHQL_URL="<url>"

Use the URL that was given to you. Or, in case you are running the
backend locally, use `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mmdata`.

### Setting Up Local Backend

To set up a local backend you need access to `https://github.com/micromentor-team/mmdata`. 
Follow the ["Getting Started" instructions](https://github.com/micromentor-team/mmdata/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md).
