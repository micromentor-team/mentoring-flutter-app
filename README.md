# MicroMentor Flutter App

This is MicroMentor's main Flutter application. 

## Getting Started

### Set up the local backend

To set up a local backend you need access to `https://github.com/micromentor-team/mmdata`. 
Follow the ["Getting Started" instructions](https://github.com/micromentor-team/mmdata/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md).

### Install the Flutter development environment and tools:

1. Install Xcode and command-line tools in the Apple App Store
2. Install Rosetta 2:


    softwareupdate --install-rosetta


3. [Install the Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
4. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImt-so7DX_gIVYotoCR3K4wxfEAAYASAAEgJTUvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

Note: Running the app in an iOS simulator requires MacOS

### Clone mm-flutter-app

The sources to the Flutter app are located at: https://github.com/micromentor-team/mm-flutter-app

    git clone git@github.com:micromentor-team/mm-flutter-app.git

#### Install the dependencies
 
If you are using the Android Studio, open `pubspec.yaml` and click on `pub get` on top right to 
install all the dependencies.

Or run this in the terminal:

   `flutter pub get`

#### Set up the environment

Create the file `/assets/.env`. If you are connecting to a local backend, add these lines to the file:

    APP_GRAPHQL_URL="http://localhost:3000/mmdata/api/graphql"
    APP_SUBSCRIPTION_URL="ws://localhost:3000/mmdata/api/graphql"

But if you want to connect to a backend in the cloud please ask a co-worker for a valid `.env`.

You may want to connect to the live backend:

    APP_GRAPHQL_URL="https://mm3-api.micromentor.org/mmdata/api/graphql"
    APP_SUBSCRIPTION_URL="wss://mm3-api.micromentor.org/mmdata/api/graphql"
